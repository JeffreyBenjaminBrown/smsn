                 * basic syntax
                     * TinkerNotes uses a slight variant of wiki list syntax
                     * basically, you have nested lists with bullets and values
                 * indentation
                     * white space before the bullet is indentation
                     * it determines the level of nesting
                     * items can be nested to any level
                         * like this...
                             * and this...
                                 * and this
                     * a child must be indented more than its parent
                        * and identically to its siblings
                        * but it can be indented differently than its cousins
                 * bullets
                    * the asterisk is the default bullet, but
                    - other strings can also be bullets
                    !! they must be 1 or 2 chars long
                    *  at least one space is required between bullet and value
                    *        but more spaces are OK
                 * blank lines

                    * they're OK
                 * ids
456:                * TinkerNotes deals with graph data where nodes have ids
bar:                * each line represents a node
Za@:                * the node has a base-64 id
       XYZ:         * for the purpose of indentation, an id prefix counts as whitespace
                 * comments
[hi!]               * comments are enclosed in square braces, and are ignored
[foo]     def:      * comments before keys before bullets before values
                 * got it?
