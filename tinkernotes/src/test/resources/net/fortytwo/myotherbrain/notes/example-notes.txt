        * basic syntax
            * TinkerNotes uses a slight variant of wiki list syntax
            * basically, you have nested notes with bullets and values
        * indentation
            * all white space before the bullet is indentation
            * it determines the degree of nesting
            * notes can be nested to any degree
                * like this...
                    * and this...
                        * and this
            * a child must be indented more than its parent
              * and identically to its siblings
              * but it can be indented differently than its cousins
        * bullets
            * the asterisk is the default bullet, but
            - other strings can also be bullets
            !! they must be 1 or 2 characters long
            *  at least one space is required between bullet and value
            *        but more spaces are OK, too
        * white space
            * tab characters are converted to four spaces each: "    "
            * all other whitespace characters count as single spaces: " "
            * newlines can be preserved with triple braces {{{
like this.
Use as many lines of text as you need.
}}}
            * 	 leading and trailing whitespace are ignored	 

            * blank lines don't matter

        * ids
0txXBm:     * each note has a base-64 id, which is indicated with a prefix
cE85nD:     * the id prefix is optional, and it is treated as white space

69qkF3:     * blank lines still don't matter
        * got it?
