                 * basic syntax
                     * TinkerNotes uses a slight variant of wiki list syntax
                     * basically, you have nested lists with bullets and values
                 * indentation
                     * white space before the bullet is indentation
                     * it determines the level of nesting
                     * items can be nested to any level
                         * like this...
                             * and this...
                                 * and this
                     * a child must be indented more than its parent
                        * and identically to its siblings
                        * but it can be indented differently than its cousins
                 * bullets
                    * the asterisk is the default bullet, but
                    - other strings can also be bullets
                    note: they must be <= 5 chars long
                    *  at least one space is required between bullet and value
                    *        but more spaces are OK
                 * blank lines

                    * they're OK
                 * id pairs
123:456:            * TinkerNotes deals with graph data where nodes and links have ids
foo:bar:            * each line represents a link a target node
&@1:Za@:                * both link and target have a base-64 id
   xyz:XYZ:         * for the purpose of indentation, an id prefix counts as whitespace
                 * comments
[hi!]               * comments are enclosed in square braces, and are ignored
[foo] abc:def:      * comments before keys before bullets before values
                 * meta-links
                    (*) these will probably go away, but for now they're supported
                 * got it?
