Extendo is a collection of knowledge-based, wearable, and ubiquitous computing components which bring together the principles of [Humanistic Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_intelligence) and the [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).

It is a personal and research-oriented project,
and there currently isn't much documentation other than my PhD thesis (in progress).
However, here is an overview of the important stuff:

* **Extend-o-Brain**: a personal knowledge base with a wiki-like interface.  Includes an Emacs client (think [Org-mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode) with graph-based instead of a tree-based structure for notes).  Extend-o-Brain is the heart and soul of Extendo.  Or at least the brain.
* **Extendo Events**: an event-handling framework for piping user actions into Semantic Web workflows, e.g. a SPARQL-based complex event processor
* **Extendo Chrome Plugin**: bookmarks web pages into Extend-o-Brain and (optionally) logs web page visits into Extendo Events
* **Monomanual Typeatron**: firmware for a particularly nifty wireless [chorded keyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorded_keyboard) which is used in connection with Extend-o-Brain
* **Omnisensory Monitron** and Monitron Server: a ubiquitous computing framework which combines Arduino hacking and sensor-based time series data with the Semantic Web.  See my presentation, [Semantics and Sensors](http://www.slideshare.net/joshsh/semantics-and-sensors).

Other stuff:

* **Extendo Android App**: for the moment, it provides a graphical Flashcards (see below) interface.  No more, no less.
* **Extend-o-Hand**: a simple glove-based gestural interface
* **Extendo OpenCalais extension**: adds [OpenCalais](http://www.opencalais.com/) entity recognition powers
* **Extendo QR code extension**: adds QR code powers
* **Extendo RFID extension**: adds UHF RFID tag recognition powers via [Alien Technology](http://www.alientechnology.com/) readers
* **Extendo speech extension**: adds speech recognition powers
* **Ardreamo**: placeholder for a sleep and dreaming wearable
* **Autotactile Fabric**: a gestural interface which acts as a "second skin", responding to the same touch sensations perceived by the wearer.  Used in an RPI research project, Intelligent Sensory Substitution.
* **Droidspeak**: a minimal vocabulary of basic sounds for use with microcontrollers.  Yes, it's a [Star Wars reference](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Binary).
* **Flashcards**: a feedback mechanism which attempts to optimize rote learning.  Good for drilling Chinese characters on long Beijing subway rides.
